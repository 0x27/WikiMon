# WikiMon
Monitors a MediaWiki Instance for page creation and deletion events in a loop.  
Designed to monitor the 32c3 wiki for fun.  
Oh, it also alerts/logs if the Wiki is not responding properly, as it has less uptime than a not-up thing. I might be able to make some cool charts of wiki uptime over time as the event goes on :)

## Configuration
Just edit the config.json file. Auth can be 0 or 1. Credentials are ignored if auth is 0.

## Running
Just run it with the config file as the arg.

## Licence
Licenced under the [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net)
